# Synapse NFT marketplace
A marketplace with unique identification using Privacy-Preserving Proof-of-Personhood Protocol (PPPoPP) 

## Purpose/the problem it solves
There are many NFT marketplaces but the developers/creators are not able to airdrop or giveaway their products because of the fact that a single user can create multiple accounts in order to claim the product. Using Worldcoin this problem can be tackled as it uses Privacy-Preserving Proof-of-Personhood Protocol (PPPoPP) which verifies if the user has executed this task before or not. Essentially this marketplace can also prevent users from creating multiple accounts and spamming.
